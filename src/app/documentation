In Next.js, a component is like a building block for your webpage. Think of it as a mini piece of a website—like a button, a header, or a navigation bar—that you can create once and use in many places.

Each component is usually a separate file with its own code. By breaking a webpage into components, you can re-use and organize your code easily. For example, if you have a header component, you can use it on every page without rewriting the code each time.

So, components help you build complex web pages by combining small, reusable pieces of code that each handle a specific part of the page.
